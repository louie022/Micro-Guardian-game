# Micro-Guardian-game

This project is part of the interactive installation for the "Design with Data - Fashion Informatics" course at the University of Edinburgh. Developed as a collaborative effort, this gesture-based 2D game aims to blend the realms of fashion and informatics, offering an engaging and innovative way to interact with fashion data.
